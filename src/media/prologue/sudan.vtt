WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:01.300


00:01.300 --> 00:03.600
In the centre of the capital Khartoum,

00:03.600 --> 00:06.600
and not far from the presidential palace,

00:06.600 --> 00:08.450
the streets have erupted in protest.

00:08.450 --> 00:10.600
The people are demanding the fall of the regime.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.000
The people are demanding freedom, and justice.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.300
The government responded by arresting many political figures

00:19.300 --> 00:22.450
who had voiced their support of the popular uprisings,

00:22.450 --> 00:24.450
without however putting forward a solution

00:24.450 --> 00:29.300
that would comply to the constitution, the law, and the demands of the parliament.

00:29.300 --> 00:34.300
Instead, they used excessive force on protesters asking for their rights,

00:34.300 --> 00:37.300
which begs the same question, yet again:

00:37.300 --> 00:39.450
where is headed Sudan?

00:39.450 --> 00:40.000
