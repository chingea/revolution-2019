WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:00.600


00:00.600 --> 00:05.600
In Santiago, many people are attempting to reach their destination,

00:05.600 --> 00:09.000
in what has already been a difficult afternoon,

00:09.000 --> 00:12.600
after authorities have announced the complete suspension of the metro,

00:12.600 --> 00:18.000
and reinforced police presence on public transport for those who are trying to get home.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.600
There are images of what is happening in downtown Santiago, including the one we are seeing now.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.000
This is a Transsantiago bus that our cameras have been following,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.600
which has been set on fire by protesters.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.600
Firefighters have tried to put it out but were attacked by protesters throwing stones at them.

00:38.600 --> 00:43.600
Unfortunately this is not happening only in the centre of Santiago.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.000
