WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000


00:01.000 --> 00:04.300
We go to Hong Kong first, where police are clashing with protesters

00:04.300 --> 00:07.000
at an unauthorised rally.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.150
Tens of thousands have defied a police ban to demonstrate,

00:11.150 --> 00:15.300
after last week-end's violence that left dozens of people injured.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.150
This has been an unauthorised protest.

00:18.150 --> 00:21.300
It began earlier today in a playground in Yuen Long at 3:00PM

00:21.300 --> 00:24.000
and we've been there following the protest as it attracted,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.600
from our count, tens of thousands of people.

00:26.600 --> 00:31.300
We also learned from the hospital authority that at least nine people have been hospitalised,

00:31.300 --> 00:34.300
the nature of their injuries or ailments: not known.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.300
We're expecting more protests to take place tomorrow, in Central.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.600
This is a summer of protests that's not gonna end anytime soon.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.000
