WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:05.600


00:05.600 --> 00:10.600
Angry protesters have filled the streets of many Lebanese cities,

00:10.600 --> 00:12.600
demanding that the government resign,

00:12.600 --> 00:15.600
and asking for the departure of a political class

00:15.600 --> 00:20.600
which they hold accountable for the economic crisis.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.600
The anger has gained momentum,

00:22.600 --> 00:27.600
and the political elite is now faced with a situation that is slowly degenerating,

00:27.600 --> 00:32.000
and streets filled with protesters who have lost any trust in politicians' empty promises.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.600
The street has demands and is made up from people of all religious confessions,

00:35.600 --> 00:39.300
but how will the political elite address them?

00:39:300 --> 00:45.000
