00:00.000 --> 00:02.900


00:02.900 --> 00:05.300
We're going to begin with breaking news tonight out of Minneapolis

00:05.300 --> 00:10.600
where the National Guard is being mobilised after a violent protest erupted overnight

00:10.600 --> 00:12.600
over the death of George Floyd.

00:12.600 --> 00:17.600
Frustration over the lack of charges against the officers turned into anger overnight,

00:17.600 --> 00:21.300
as protesters looted stores and set buildings on fire.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.300
Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.000
Those riots continue today, spilling into St. Paul,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.300
where crowds ransacked shops and smashed windows.

00:30.100 --> 00:34.300
And it all comes as Minnesota and the rest of the country are facing the dual toll

00:34.300 --> 00:37.600
of rising jobless claims and cases of coronavirus.

00:37.600 --> 00:45.000
