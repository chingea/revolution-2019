WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:05.600


00:05.600 --> 00:08.000
Bogotá and other cities in Colombia

00:08.000 --> 00:15.300
have had a day of marches, protests and, in some cases, disturbance and vandalism.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.600
The images that we have captured throughout the day

00:18.600 --> 00:22.600
show a massive civilian turnout at today's protests,

00:22.600 --> 00:27.000
mainly in Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, Bucaramanga, Popayán and Barranquilla.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.450
In the late afternoon, Bogotá's Plaza Bolivár

00:29.450 --> 00:34.450
was the backdrop of severe disturbances, attacks on police and vandalism

00:34.450 --> 00:37.150
on the buildings surrounding the square,

00:37.150 --> 00:40.600
including the Sagrario chapel.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.000
